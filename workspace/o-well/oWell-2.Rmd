## Reading the saudi.txt file that contains all the data of 23 wells obtained from o-well assignment 1, including fault, geology, metal types, chemical parameters.
```{r}
library(readr)
saudi <- read_delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quynh-tran419/WSU_STAT419/master/workspace/o-well/dataset/saudi.txt", "|", escape_double = FALSE )
saudi = data.frame(saudi)
saudi
metals <- read_delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quynh-tran419/WSU_STAT419/master/workspace/o-well/dataset/metals.txt", "|", escape_double = FALSE )

```


## It is mentioned that northern located wells (Th mean is 1549mg/L) tend to have a higher level of hardness compared to southern located wells (TH mean is 1098mg/L). So how does the amount of Calcium cations relate to where the wells located and theirs hardness?
## The bubble chart shows that the more Calcium cations present in the water, the higher the level of water hardness is.


```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=7.5}

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
ggplot(saudi, aes(latitude,TH,size = Ca, color = factor(well))) +
  geom_point(alpha =0.7) +
  scale_size(range = c(0.1,20), name = "Ca") +
  ggtitle("The correlation between the latitude,total hardness,and the amount of dissolved Ca of each well") +
  xlab("Latitude") + ylab("Total Hardness") 

```

# With the statistics for dissolved metals results of groundwater in 23 wells, how do I indicate the amount of each metal present in each well? 
# This connected scatter chart shows how much each metal presents and the major metal presents in each well. For example, well #1 contains the most Fe while well #23 contains the least. Similarly,
